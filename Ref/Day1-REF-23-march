Concepts --------> Syntax ----------> Best Practices 


Java
-----------
    - introduced in 1991, initially called as 'OAK'
    - originally developed by Sun Microsystems, but later bought by Oracle
    - JDK 1.0, the first major version of java, introducted in 1995 // Jan 1996
    - JDK 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 ..... 14
    - Java 7
    - Java 8
    - platform-independent programming language 

Java Editions
---------------------------
Java SE / J2SE
    -> Core Java 
    -> consist of most basic / standard libraries / general purpose apis
            i.e. collection framework, IO, util, lang,
            i.e. variables, data types, arrays, strings, Streams, 
    -> mainly used to create applications for desktop environment  

Java EE / J2EE
    -> is used to create web apps, server side apps, networking, web services, etc.
    -> it is community driven edition, which consist of contributions from industry experts 
        i.e Servlet, JavaBeans, Messaging services, Security, Data Persistence i.e. JPA 


Java ME / J2ME
    -> concentrated for the applications running on embedded systems, mobiles and small devices 


Java Features
---------------------
    -> Object oriented programming language 



JVM
    - Java Virtual Machine
    - responsible to execute Byte Code(.class file) on given platform

JRE 
    - Java Runtime environement 
    - JVM + libraries 

JDK 
    - Java Developemnt Kit 
    - JRE + dev tools i.e. compiler (javac), debugger, packaging tools etc. 

variables
---------------------

1. local variables 
        - variables declared inside a method/constructor/block 
        - must be intialized before 1st used
        - memory for local variables is allocated, when the method is invoked, destroyed when the method completes 

        - access modifiers can not be used 

2. instance variables 
        - variables decalred inside a class, but outside method/constructor/block 
        - memory is allocated for instance variables, whenver we create object using 'new' keyword

                Student s1 = new Student()
        - can have access modifiers 
        - instance variables have default values (default constuctor initializes values to the instance variables)
            numbers     = 0
            booleans    = false
            ref types   = null

3. static/class variables 

    - variables decalred inside a class, but outside method/constructor/block
            using 'static' keyword 
    - only 1 copy of static variable is allocated per class
    - they are associated only with the class 
    - using class name they can accessed directly 
    - memory for static variables is allocated whenever the class is loaded  
    - default values are similar to instance variables 
    - can have access modifiers 

Data types
-------------------

    1. primitive types 
            - represent values directly 
            - 8 primitive types in java

                    byte 
                    short 
                    int 
                    long 
                    float
                    double 
                    char
                    boolean 

    2. reference types
            - represent reference/address to the memory
            - Array, String, class, Interface type varaibles are reference types  

                    int arr[];
                    String str;
                    Student s1;

    Naming conventions
    ----------------------------
    variables           : camelcased        int number;  int age;  int productName;

    methods             : camel cased       void showStud() void calArea()

    class/Interface     : 1st letter should be capital 
                            class Student
                            interface Printable
